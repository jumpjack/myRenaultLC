# myRenaultLC
 Standalone browser page to access Renault vehicles data
 
Available here: http://jumpjack.altervista.org/myrenault

and here: https://jumpjack.github.io/myRenaultLC/

 **Note: the page is experimental, use at your own risk**

Fill in your MyRenault credentials (email and password), then select the endpoint from the list, and click QUERY button. Some endpoints have two versions available, depending on your car: try both; if the endpoint exists, you'll see the output in the output panel, else you'll see a "404" error if endpoint does not exists, or other numbers if you missed some additional parameters in the endpoint.

Security warning
----------------

If you don't want to fill-in your credentials in an unknown page, download the page to your PC: you will get an index.html file and many .js files into same folder. Just open index.html in your favourite browser and start testing.

Since version 2.4.0 the web page uses a php script ( https://github.com/jumpjack/myRenaultLC/blob/main/gigya-login.php ) located in its own folder to perform authentication on Gigya server; the user can use the script he prefers, as long as it returns this structure:


	{
		"loginData" : {
			"cookie" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" ,
			"JWT" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
			"personId" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
		}
	}

Syntax for calling the script:

    /gigya-login.php?gigyakey=XXXXXXXXX&gigyasite=XXXXXXXX&kamereon=XXXXXXXX&username=XXXXXXXXX&password=XXXXXXXX

- gigyakey:  see https://github.com/jumpjack/myRenaultLC/blob/main/myrenault-public.js
- gigyasite: see https://github.com/jumpjack/myRenaultLC/blob/main/myrenault-public.js
- kamereon:  see https://github.com/jumpjack/myRenaultLC/blob/main/myrenault-public.js
- username: Of MyRenault app
- password: Of MyRenault app

**Note:** the page can call a php script in its own folder works only if the page is stored on a server supporting php; if you are unsing the page locally, you must host the script on a servert supporting php, and specify its full url in the page:

## Retrieving data without logging in

If you don't want to put at all your credential, you can perform a strandard login on MyRenault official web page (for Italy: https://myr.renault.it/documentazione.html ) and go to "vehicle details" tab/page. Then swith to console mode, and look for:

 - accountId
 - JWT token (named "oneSession" in cookies list)

Refer to following pictures to retrieve data:

Put data in the web page:

Now you can temporarily download data; JWT token will expire in some minutes, and you will have to login again to MyRenault page and copy it again; accountId and VIN remain of course unchanged.
